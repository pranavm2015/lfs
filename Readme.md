# Project Details

Our project was to introduce an online seat booking system for our college library which will
be functional throughout the year and an online system to verify whether a person is in
his/her respective room or not which would solve this problem completely.

## Group Members:
1. Pranav Mutharia
2. Varun Garg 
3. Yogendra Singh 
4. Mithilesh Hinge

## Technologies Used:

1. Front-End : For the Web portal Python and Django have been used

2. Back-End : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and HubL 

3. Hardware : Arduino UNO and PIR Sensors for Faculty Appointment

4. Application : Developed using Android Studio.

## Goals Achieved:
We have come up with a Web Portal as well as an Android Application which allows you to book a seat in the Library or to use the Faculty Appointment System. 
The user can submit any suggestions/bugs in the website via Contact us Form. The About Us page is basically the aim and objectives of our project. Once the user has logged in, he/she will be recognized if he/she is a faculty or a student and different options would be available accordingly. For the students, two options are available, either Book Appointment to meet the Teacher or Book a seat in the Library.
The Application has same functionality as the Web Portal and is self explanatory as well.
